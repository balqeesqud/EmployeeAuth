# EmployeeAuth (Lab14)

## Description

For this lab In this project, I have developed an Employee website that offers employees the capability to create their
own accounts by signing up,& log in securely, and then begin posting content. For individuals who haven't yet 
registered, they will only have access to the general homepage. To participate in posting content, they will first need 
to create an account.

Packages I created for this lab:
- Controllers :
  1. AuthController
  2. EmployeeController
  3. HomeController
  4. PostsController
  
- exception

- models
  1. EmployeeUser
  2. UserPosts 
  
- repositories
  1. EmployeeJpa
  2. PostsJpa
